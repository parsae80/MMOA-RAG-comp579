# PPO Module ‚Äì LLaMA-Factory

The `ppo/` directory implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a reinforcement learning technique used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on human feedback. This module is integral to the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipeline within LLaMA-Factory, enabling models to align more closely with human preferences.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

- **`trainer.py`**: The core script that defines the PPO training loop, handling policy updates, reward computations, and optimization steps.

- **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions that support the training process, such as advantage estimation, reward normalization, and logging mechanisms.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To utilize the PPO module for fine-tuning an LLM:

1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the main `requirements.txt` of the LLaMA-Factory project.

2. **Configure Training Parameters**:
   - Create or modify a YAML configuration file specifying model paths, datasets, hyperparameters, and other training settings.

3. **Initiate Training**:
   - Use the LLaMA-Factory CLI or appropriate script to start the PPO training process:
     ```bash
     python src/train.py --config path_to_config.yaml
     ```

4. **Monitor Training**:
   - Utilize integrated logging tools (e.g., TensorBoard, Weights & Biases) to track training progress and performance metrics.

## üìå Notes

- The PPO module is designed to work seamlessly with other components of the LLaMA-Factory framework, including data preprocessing and evaluation modules.

- For optimal performance, ensure that the reward model used for training is well-aligned with the desired outcomes.

- Refer to the main LLaMA-Factory documentation for detailed guidance on setting up datasets and configuring training runs.
