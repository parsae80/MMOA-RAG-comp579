PPO Module – LLaMA-Factory
The ppo/ directory implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a reinforcement learning technique used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on human feedback. This module is integral to the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipeline within LLaMA-Factory, enabling models to align more closely with human preferences.​

📁 Directory Structure
trainer.py: The core script that defines the PPO training loop, handling policy updates, reward computations, and optimization steps.​

utils.py: Contains utility functions that support the training process, such as advantage estimation, reward normalization, and logging mechanisms.​

🚀 Getting Started
To utilize the PPO module for fine-tuning an LLM:

Prepare the Environment:

Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the main requirements.txt of the LLaMA-Factory project.​

Configure Training Parameters:

Create or modify a YAML configuration file specifying model paths, datasets, hyperparameters, and other training settings.​
Medium

Initiate Training:

Use the LLaMA-Factory CLI or appropriate script to start the PPO training process:​

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/train.py --config path_to_config.yaml
Monitor Training:

Utilize integrated logging tools (e.g., TensorBoard, Weights & Biases) to track training progress and performance metrics.​

📌 Notes
The PPO module is designed to work seamlessly with other components of the LLaMA-Factory framework, including data preprocessing and evaluation modules.​

For optimal performance, ensure that the reward model used for training is well-aligned with the desired outcomes.​
